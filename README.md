# duo_dash
Fun and challenging arcade style puzzle game.

### Description:
Control two parallel characters in a fun arcade style puzzle game. Dash from wall to wall, and make sure to avoid all the spikes - there's a lot of them! Big spikes instantly kill when touched, and small spikes activate only after touched. The game may be challenging, but it's worth it!

### Controls:
Arrow keys to move the character.  "z" and "x" to navigate the menu.

### Notes:
The Lua file contains only the code for the game from PICO-8, and not assets including sprites, tilemap, sfx, and music. Those can be found in p8 or zip files. This game can also be found on Lexaloffle's website to be played at: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=139810

# duo_dash
Fun and challenging arcade style puzzle game.

### Description:
Control two parallel characters in a fun arcade style puzzle game. Dash from wall to wall, and make sure to avoid all the spikes - there's a lot of them! The game may be challenging, but it's worth it!

### Controls:
Arrow keys to move the character.  "z" and "x" to navigate the menu.

### Notes:
The lua file only contains the code for the game, and not assets including sprites, tilemap, sfx, and music. Those can be found in p8 or zip files.
